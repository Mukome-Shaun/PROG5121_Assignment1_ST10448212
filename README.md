The main problem this inventory management system aims to solve is the need for a small business to efficiently track and manage its product inventory using a simple console-based application. Currently, the business struggles with manual inventory tracking, as there is no systematic way to record and update stock levels for different products. This is especially challenging because the business deals with both regular items, such as electronics, and perishable goods, such as food items with expiry dates. The lack of a proper system leads to frequent errors in stock counts, which increases the chances of overstocking or running out of essential products.
Another challenge the business faces is the absence of low stock alerts. Since there is no mechanism to notify employees when stock levels fall below a critical threshold, such as 10 units, popular items often become unavailable. This not only disappoints customers but also results in lost sales. Along with this, restocking decisions are made reactively instead of proactively, since employees do not have a clear overview of the current inventory. This causes delays in restocking and sometimes leads to unnecessary excess ordering.
The business also struggles with the lack of reporting. Without an automated way to generate a summary of current stock levels, it becomes difficult to assess the overall inventory situation or plan future purchases effectively. On top of this, there is a need for flexible user input. Employees require an easy way to add new products into the system without relying on complex software, but the current manual process is slow and prone to mistakes.
This system is designed to address these issues for a small retail or grocery business that operates with a limited product range. Since these types of businesses often rely heavily on manual oversight, introducing automation through this inventory management system will help improve efficiency, reduce errors, and make stock management much easier.
